In 1957, the launch of Sputnik marked a new era for mankind as humans reached beyond the Earth and into the heavens.  The dawn of the space era led to scientific breakthroughs and technological innovations that forever changed the human way of life.  Today, modern governments and militaries are highly dependent on space technology to function, and the United States (U.S.) uses this advanced equipment to wage its modern style of war.  Space technology enables the U.S. to conduct quick decisive operations with decentralized units and precision weapons—the new American way of war. Though space-based technology is a cornerstone of the modern American military, the U.S. is teetering dangerously close to an overreliance on this technology.  With increased tensions between the U.S. and state actors such as Russia, a reliance on spaced-based technology creates startling vulnerabilities.  An adversary capable of jamming satellite signals or attacking satellite infrastructure could cause catastrophic failures across the spectrum of operations. Making matters worse, little exists in the way of protection or contingency plans in the event of such an attack.  This paints a stark reality: an overreliance on advanced technology is putting the U.S. in a vulnerable position.  However, emerging technologies in miniature satellites provide potential solutions to this critical vulnerability.  Cube satellites, for example, are 10cm3 satellites designed to fly in a low earth orbit.  Their relatively small size and low orbit altitude makes them an inexpensive and potentially quick alternative to traditional satellites and gives rise to unique applications.   Given that the American way of war is now inexorably linked to space-based technology and thus increasingly vulnerable, could the U.S. build a stockpile of cube satellites ready for launch as a short-term solution to prepare for and protect against adversaries capable of exploiting such vulnerabilities?
