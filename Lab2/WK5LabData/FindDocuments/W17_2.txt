Transregional threats have no respect for nation state sovereignty and ‘official’ borders. To the contrary, they capitalize on seams between states and regions. The United States and its allies must develop transregional solutions to close those gaps and perceived opportunities. How do they do that? Generally, how do SOF address transregional threats using all the elements of national power when most, if not all, United States Government (USG) departments and agencies are configured along national or regional lines? What constructs exist, or should exist, to synchronize USG transregional efforts below the National Security Strategy level? What is the role of the U.S. country team, who by definition is narrowly focused on a single country, in addressing transregional threats? What current agency/departmental cultures exist that hinder this collaboration, and how do SOF overcome them? How can partner nations be best incorporated in transregional efforts? SOF often operate outside of the theaters of war to achieve a TSOC’s campaign support plan objectives. That is often accomplished in conjunction with other USG agencies—whether officially designated or out of necessity for resources and authorities, to achieve mission success. What are the best practices toward attaining interagency cooperation and interdependence? What are the objective barriers to success? What defines mission success versus the success of cooperation? What challenges do SOF personnel face when operating with a whole-of-government approach?
