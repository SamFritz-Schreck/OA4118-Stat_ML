Online recruitment and social network node analysis Through social media Salafi jihadist organizations employ global recruitment campaigns to both support a caliphate concept and wage jihad throughout the world. While thousands of social media handles can, in some fashion, connect would-be radicals, there may very well be only a select group of nodes serving as key gateways in advancing jihadist propaganda. Some of these nodes may be unaware of their role and credibility in building a jihadi recruitment base. Defeating jihadi campaigns likely will require identifying these nodes and attacking them directly via counter-messaging. While there are a number of ongoing studies on jihadist social media, what new analytic approaches can yield additional insight on key nodes? How can these approaches better identify and assess threats?
