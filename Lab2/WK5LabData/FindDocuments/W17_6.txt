Within groups of people there exist the social phenomena called team cohesion and human chemistry. Although both concepts refer to psychological unions of individuals, they bear subtle differences in how their catalysts for attraction operate. Team cohesion develops in response to external elements--such as suffering or shared goals--and is thus easy for group leaders to manufacture or cultivate for the benefit of the team. Human chemistry--sometimes referred to as charisma or animal attraction--exists solely within the human psyche, and is difficult to predict, much less manufacture. Army leaders excel at building teams through cohesion (or aptly named “team-building”) events; however, unless those leaders specialize in psychology, or have spent many years working closely with unique individuals, they do not have many mechanisms to predict whether the individuals within a team will naturally “click” or seek to work together in the absence of an external, unifying event.
