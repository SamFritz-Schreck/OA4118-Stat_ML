Talent management is a current, relevant issue military unit leaders face. The number of human resources available--particularly those with beneficial or required experiences and skills--are limited, and as a result leaders must invest deliberate thought and consideration into how they build teams fit for the missions at hand. Army units, depending upon their sizes, capabilities, and budgets, have an array of available talent management tools to help leaders optimize whom they hire and where they put these people. However, unless the unit is at the regiment level or higher, many of these tools are limited in scope to job highly generalized, and often embellished, performance reports and experience resumes.
