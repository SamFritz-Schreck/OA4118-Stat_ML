Matchmaking algorithms seek to articulate human chemistry in an effort to draw people into positive relationships. While imperfect, the continual collection and refinement of data is increasing the potential of algorithms to better predict human chemistry as it relates to naturally-forming relationships. Although these algorithms are typically advertised as being able to help build two-person relationships, it is becoming more likely that these algorithms may be able to expand to help build or refine multi-person teams.
