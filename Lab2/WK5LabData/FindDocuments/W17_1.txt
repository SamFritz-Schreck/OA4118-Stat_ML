On 31 December 2014, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) support in Afghanistan transitioned from combat to a train, advise, and assist mission, and is officially known as Operation Resolute Support (ORS). The United States military mission in Afghanistan, the post-2014 follow-on to Operation Enduring Freedom, is known as Operation Freedom’s Sentinel. It is part of the NATO-led ORS and consists of two components. 

One is working with allies as part of the train, advise, and assist mission, and the second is to conduct counterterrorism operations against the remnants of al-Qaeda to ensure that Afghanistan is never again used to stage attacks against the homeland. 

The terrorist threat worldwide remains high. How will the transition in Afghanistan affect the targeting of terrorist networks worldwide? There are numerous strategic and national-level policies enacted in recent years governing targeting operations, not only in Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan, but worldwide. How will they be effected? Are there other considerations for the SOF targeting process? Current events convey significant and violent changes around the globe. Which agency should have the lead? How might interagency responsibilities and mutual assistance be refined? What, if any, authorities gaps exist? How can SOF continue to ensure that counterterrorist efforts outpace terror networks’ ability to regenerate?
