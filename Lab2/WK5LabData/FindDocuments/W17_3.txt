Current conventional, hybrid, and subnational threats have prompted NATO SOF to address security concerns from a regional perspective. As a result of the Crimean annexation, for example, Poland and the Baltic States have polarized SOF assets around Polish SOF command and control (C2). Other regions could follow suit. This approach allows SOF-capable nations to help mitigate security challenges by compensating for a partner nation’s SOF capability limitations (perhaps through multinational SOF capability packages). How would historical enmities within a region impact such an approach? Would such an approach provide increased effectiveness from a cost-benefit perspective? How could the U.S. foreign internal defense (FID) mission set support such an approach? What status-of-forces agreement or other legal considerations would need to be addressed? Could theme-focused hubs (as opposed to regional hubs) provide a better solution when addressing transregional threats? What would be the  advantages and disadvantages, constraints, and obstacles associated with multinational SOF basing? What countries and regions are best suited to multinational basing? What lessons can be learned from past joint and multinational basing efforts?
