This thesis aims to leverage the ABRC/EU model to explore potential solutions to one of AFRICOM’s enduring problems, concerning the terrorist group Boko Haram, by answering the following questions: What are the prospects for negotiating with Boko Haram? What are the likely terms of settlement between the Lake Chad Basin region countries (Cameroon, Niger, Nigeria and Chad) and Boko Haram? This thesis applies a version of Mesquita’s (1994 & 2009) expected utility model developed at RAND (Jesse, 2011), coupled with social networking analysis from the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS), on data collected of the preferences, capabilities, and saliences of the set of actors who are likely to try to influence the outcome in a potential multilateral engagement
