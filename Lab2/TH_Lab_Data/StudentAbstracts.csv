Name,Abstract
Student 1,"On 31 December 2014, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) support in Afghanistan transitioned from combat to a train, advise, and assist mission, and is officially known as Operation Resolute Support (ORS). The United States military mission in Afghanistan, the post-2014 follow-on to Operation Enduring Freedom, is known as Operation FreedomÍs Sentinel. It is part of the NATO-led ORS and consists of two components. One is working with allies as part of the train, advise, and assist mission, and the second is to conduct counterterrorism operations against the remnants of al-Qaeda to ensure that Afghanistan is never again used to stage attacks against the homeland. The terrorist threat worldwide remains high. How will the transition in Afghanistan affect the targeting of terrorist networks worldwide? There are numerous strategic and national-level policies enacted in recent years governing targeting operations, not only in Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan, but worldwide. How will they be effected? Are there other considerations for the SOF targeting process? Current events convey significant and violent changes around the globe. Which agency should have the lead? How might interagency responsibilities and mutual assistance be refined? What, if any, authorities gaps exist? How can SOF continue to ensure that counterterrorist efforts outpace terror networksÍ ability to regenerate?"
Student 2,"Transregional threats have no respect for nation state sovereignty and ïofficialÍ borders. To the contrary, they capitalize on seams between states and regions. The United States and its allies must develop transregional solutions to close those gaps and perceived opportunities. How do they do that? Generally, how do SOF address transregional threats using all the elements of national power when most, if not all, United States Government (USG) departments and agencies are configured along national or regional lines? What constructs exist, or should exist, to synchronize USG transregional efforts below the National Security Strategy level? What is the role of the U.S. country team, who by definition is narrowly focused on a single country, in addressing transregional threats? What current agency/departmental cultures exist that hinder this collaboration, and how do SOF overcome them? How can partner nations be best incorporated in transregional efforts? SOF often operate outside of the theaters of war to achieve a TSOCÍs campaign support plan objectives. That is often accomplished in conjunction with other USG agencies„whether officially designated or out of necessity for resources and authorities, to achieve mission success. What are the best practices toward attaining interagency cooperation and interdependence? What are the objective barriers to success? What defines mission success versus the success of cooperation? What challenges do SOF personnel face when operating with a whole-of-government approach?"
Student 3,"Current conventional, hybrid, and subnational threats have prompted NATO SOF to address security concerns from a regional perspective. As a result of the Crimean annexation, for example, Poland and the Baltic States have polarized SOF assets around Polish SOF command and control (C2). Other regions could follow suit. This approach allows SOF-capable nations to help mitigate security challenges by compensating for a partner nationÍs SOF capability limitations (perhaps through multinational SOF capability packages). How would historical enmities within a region impact such an approach? Would such an approach provide increased effectiveness from a cost-benefit perspective? How could the U.S. foreign internal defense (FID) mission set support such an approach? What status-of-forces agreement or other legal considerations would need to be addressed? Could theme-focused hubs (as opposed to regional hubs) provide a better solution when addressing transregional threats? What would be the  advantages and disadvantages, constraints, and obstacles associated with multinational SOF basing? What countries and regions are best suited to multinational basing? What lessons can be learned from past joint and multinational basing efforts?"
Student 4,"Online recruitment and social network node analysis Through social media Salafi jihadist organizations employ global recruitment campaigns to both support a caliphate concept and wage jihad throughout the world. While thousands of social media handles can, in some fashion, connect would-be radicals, there may very well be only a select group of nodes serving as key gateways in advancing jihadist propaganda. Some of these nodes may be unaware of their role and credibility in building a jihadi recruitment base. Defeating jihadi campaigns likely will require identifying these nodes and attacking them directly via counter-messaging. While there are a number of ongoing studies on jihadist social media, what new analytic approaches can yield additional insight on key nodes? How can these approaches better identify and assess threats?"
Student 5,"Talent management is a current, relevant issue military unit leaders face. The number of human resources available--particularly those with beneficial or required experiences and skills--are limited, and as a result leaders must invest deliberate thought and consideration into how they build teams fit for the missions at hand. Army units, depending upon their sizes, capabilities, and budgets, have an array of available talent management tools to help leaders optimize whom they hire and where they put these people. However, unless the unit is at the regiment level or higher, many of these tools are limited in scope to job highly generalized, and often embellished, performance reports and experience resumes."
Student 6,"Within groups of people there exist the social phenomena called team cohesion and human chemistry. Although both concepts refer to psychological unions of individuals, they bear subtle differences in how their catalysts for attraction operate. Team cohesion develops in response to external elements--such as suffering or shared goals--and is thus easy for group leaders to manufacture or cultivate for the benefit of the team. Human chemistry--sometimes referred to as charisma or animal attraction--exists solely within the human psyche, and is difficult to predict, much less manufacture. Army leaders excel at building teams through cohesion (or aptly named ñteam-buildingî) events; however, unless those leaders specialize in psychology, or have spent many years working closely with unique individuals, they do not have many mechanisms to predict whether the individuals within a team will naturally ñclickî or seek to work together in the absence of an external, unifying event."
Student 7,"Matchmaking algorithms seek to articulate human chemistry in an effort to draw people into positive relationships. While imperfect, the continual collection and refinement of data is increasing the potential of algorithms to better predict human chemistry as it relates to naturally-forming relationships. Although these algorithms are typically advertised as being able to help build two-person relationships, it is becoming more likely that these algorithms may be able to expand to help build or refine multi-person teams."
Student 8,"The Royal Canadian Air Force has failed to pivot towards the deepening operational relevance of CANSOFCOM. In its capstone document, Air Force Vectors, the RCAF clusters SOF with Space and Cyber activities, which are both significantly more niche and less mature than CANSOFCOM. With more than ten years of domestic and expeditionary SOF operations in support of CanadaÍs national interest, CANSOFCOM has become a highly reliable organization. The future shows no end to the prominence of SOF, which the RCAF must acknowledge and endorse. SOF has a role to play in this as well. CANSOFCOM must cohere an assessment of the future which steers its development, generation, management and sustainment writ large while specifically encompassing SOF-specific air power. Numerous trends in air and aviation indicate that the future of air power may look significantly different than today. First, it is assessed that any assets in the air domain will be a mixture of manned and unmanned assets. The use of unmanned systems is assured, to the point where a better question might be whether or not manned assets will continue to fly. A subsequent trend of future air and aviation to consider is that of the next generation of rotary wing platforms. Future rotary wing assets could trend towards super-helos, personified in the Sikorsky SB Defiant, or the tilt-rotor class of aircraft platforms, most notably the Bell V280 Valour. Regardless of which path future SOF aviation takes, it appears evident that the payload and range differentiation between helicopters and fixed wing assets will continue to coalesce in the tactical realm. Turning to future precision strike assets, the future has a potential schism lurking in the shadows between highly complex fifth and sixth generation stealth fighters, and simple, down-teched light fighters, such as the A-29 Super Tucano. Last, all the collection and action assets aside, the sheer depth and breadth of data requiring processing, exploitation and dissemination is a daunting challenge for any military element, let alone a relatively minor SOF Command. The increase in unmanned assets, artificial intelligence, future fixed and rotary wing platforms, and challenges in exploitation and dissemination of intelligence will affect the Canadian Armed Forces well into the future. There are significant and valuable implications for CANSOFCOM which will help steer capability and capacity development well into the future."
Student 9,"Research Question: Is there an America identity crisis? If so, is it a threat to national security?  Introduction: This thesis will explore American Identity (what it means to be an American) and whether or not this lack of identity can be exploited by the adversaries and competitors of the United States. We propose, that if America does not get less divided or re-establish its identity, adversaries will take advantage. This thesis will need to address key American divides and why they matter. Identity issues are causing political unrest all over the world. This apparent identity crisis seems to have become most apparent during the recent US Presidential election, but existed well before that season. American priorities and involvement in the international system appear to be shifting. Considering the WestÍs remarkable achievements of the past three centuries, it would seem appropriate to analyze the cause for this seeming seismic shift in national priorities. Scholars, pundits, and layman alike have attempted to define American Identity throughout the course of American history. While many present convincing arguments, none fully reflect the nation that exists today. The United States have evolved through social, moral, political, ethnic, and cultural changes that require much more breadth to in defining what it means to be an American. Since domestic identity shapes foreign policy, it is imperative to fully understand the American identity in order to appropriately apply it to foreign policy dilemmas. Similarly, before the nation can adequately defend against attacks against its identity„or identities„it must understand them. Some have defined American Identity by saying that, ñAmerica is a predominantly Christian nation and becoming more soî (Samuel Huntington) or, ñAmerican Identity is pathologically aggressive and warlikeî (Walter Hixson) or something wholly different. This thesis will analyze these and many similar arguments to determine if they truly reflect all Americans. This challenge is complex and demanding, as America consists of a richly diverse people, not only in ethnicity, culture, and heritage, but also in moral values. With the value of the individual clearly outlined in the Declaration of Independence and protected by the Constitution, this identity must be extremely broad with massive appeal. This analysis of the American Identity will include new research in social psychology and argue that our tribal nature facilitates these divisions and therefore, damages foreign policy initiatives resulting in greater threats to national security. AmericaÍs foreign policy should reflect the values of its culture, emphasizing individual liberty in a vastly multicultural environment and not denying but, accepting opposing viewpoints. A politically divided America is healthy until cultural hegemony is achieved by one class, political party, or race. This can lead to real or perceived fissures that could be exploited to threaten, or perhaps even reduce, US hegemony. Now, more than ever, it is essential to ask, does America lack an identity? Once this initial question is answered, this thesis will explore the extent to which adversaries can take advantage of these divisions and/or how they might further exploit division within the United States."
Student 10,"In 1957, the launch of Sputnik marked a new era for mankind as humans reached beyond the Earth and into the heavens.  The dawn of the space era led to scientific breakthroughs and technological innovations that forever changed the human way of life.  Today, modern governments and militaries are highly dependent on space technology to function, and the United States (U.S.) uses this advanced equipment to wage its modern style of war.  Space technology enables the U.S. to conduct quick decisive operations with decentralized units and precision weapons„the new American way of war. Though space-based technology is a cornerstone of the modern American military, the U.S. is teetering dangerously close to an overreliance on this technology.  With increased tensions between the U.S. and state actors such as Russia, a reliance on spaced-based technology creates startling vulnerabilities.  An adversary capable of jamming satellite signals or attacking satellite infrastructure could cause catastrophic failures across the spectrum of operations. Making matters worse, little exists in the way of protection or contingency plans in the event of such an attack.  This paints a stark reality: an overreliance on advanced technology is putting the U.S. in a vulnerable position.  However, emerging technologies in miniature satellites provide potential solutions to this critical vulnerability.  Cube satellites, for example, are 10cm3 satellites designed to fly in a low earth orbit.  Their relatively small size and low orbit altitude makes them an inexpensive and potentially quick alternative to traditional satellites and gives rise to unique applications.   Given that the American way of war is now inexorably linked to space-based technology and thus increasingly vulnerable, could the U.S. build a stockpile of cube satellites ready for launch as a short-term solution to prepare for and protect against adversaries capable of exploiting such vulnerabilities?"
Student 11,"Unconventional Restraint: Present-day obstacles to the proper employment of ARSOF in Unconventional Warfare There appears to be no end in sight for international conflicts drawing the United StatesÍ (U.S.) attention abroad.  Beyond established theaters of war, clandestine threats from persistent malign actors, such as violent terrorist organizations and radical foreign leaders, continue to threaten U.S. interests requiring a timely and commensurate response.  From clandestine elements of the Russia Federation invading Ukraine to Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) fighters taking swathes of territory in Iraq, Syria, and Libya, the U.S. and its allies must face these challenges in short order to prevent their transition into existential threats against the homeland.  Yet, the United States has limited its own range of military options in multiple theaters of war by precluding Army Special Operations ForcesÍ (ARSOF), US Special Operations CommandÍs (SOCOM) lead component for Unconventional Warfare (UW), from applying UW tactics and techniques. Obstacles to ARSOFÍs employment vary widely and potentially include contemporary political considerations, organizational limitations, legal restrictions, distorted capabilities and risk tolerance.  Despite this breadth of potential obstacles, detailed analysis of these variables and their effects on ARSOFÍs ability to navigate the modern operational environment may offer clear insight into real, viable means of surmounting these difficulties and ultimately heighten ARSOFÍs contribution to the pursuit of US interests. Given that direct support to resistance forces (as outlined in Joint Publication 3-0, ñJoint Operationsî) is a valid solution to achieve certain U.S. government interests, what are the significant obstacles to the employment of ARSOF elements in support to resistance activities? Present-day obstacles to the proper employment of ARSOF in Unconventional Warfare In the books Savage Wars of Peace and Invisible Armies, Max Boot chronicled the United StatesÍ involvement in numerous ñsmall wars;î those military actions in the ambiguous space between war and peace.  Similar to the past, the United States currently faces challenges from both state and non-state actors in Ukraine, Crimea, Syria, Yemen, and Libya, to name a few.  These types of quasi-conflicts are unlikely to go away anytime soon, and US Presidents will continue look to subordinate agencies for viable, timely, cost effective, low-risk and low-exposure options to pursue US Government interests.   In 2001, as the Twin Towers smoldered, President Bush looked to his Cabinet for solutions.  Although he was presented with a myriad of options from ñthe Washington Playbook,î it was ultimately the CIA and SOCOMÍs plan to hunt down Al Qaeda (AQ) and foment a popular resistance movement to oust the Taliban that won.  In less than three months, three Special Forces Teams, a handful of CIA and JSOC personnel, thousands of Northern Alliance Fighters, an earth-shaking amount of airpower and several million dollars in cash toppled the Taliban Regime and drove AQ from Afghanistan.  Although supporting resistance organization is not always the answer, there are certainly instances where leveraging a resistance organization ñto coerce, disrupt or overthrow a government or occupying powerî is a superior choice to diplomatic or conventional military options.  In these instances, US Army Special Operations Command (USASOC) stands ready as SOCOMÍs lead component for this particular type of mission, or unconventional warfare (UW) as it is formally defined in military doctrine.  As the lead component, USASOC has heavily emphasized the importance of UW.  Examples of this renewed emphasis include: updates to doctrine, transformation of entire Special Forces Battalions, yearly execution of a UW exercise and the creation of new training courses focused solely on UW. Despite overwhelming success in 2001 and a renewed emphasis on doctrine, training and capabilities"
Student 12,"This thesis aims to leverage the ABRC/EU model to explore potential solutions to one of AFRICOMÍs enduring problems, concerning the terrorist group Boko Haram, by answering the following questions: What are the prospects for negotiating with Boko Haram? What are the likely terms of settlement between the Lake Chad Basin region countries (Cameroon, Niger, Nigeria and Chad) and Boko Haram? This thesis applies a version of MesquitaÍs (1994 & 2009) expected utility model developed at RAND (Jesse, 2011), coupled with social networking analysis from the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS), on data collected of the preferences, capabilities, and saliences of the set of actors who are likely to try to influence the outcome in a potential multilateral engagement"
Student 13,"In the most recent change to the Unified Command Plan (UCP), authority for global synchronization of the Counter Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) mission transferred from United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) to the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). With that change, an already overburdened USSOCOM became the lead agency for a US government response to any event dealing with the worldÍs most deadly weapons of mass destruction (WMD) _ nuclear, chemical, and biological _ whether they come in the form of state-sponsored actions or from attacks by non-state actors. Without additional funds, or substantial re-organization, USSOCOM must strengthen relationships with existing networks to adequately deal with a global WMD threat. A real-world CWMD response would likely involve US interagency task forces and, in most cases, agencies in foreign partner nations. Collaboration and interdependence between agencies must be present to ensure information sharing across not only U.S. networks, but those of partner nations as well. Understanding how South Korean agencies work together may help strengthen and improve relationships with other partner nations since each country has unique internal organizations for dealing with WMD, and dealing with each will have its own challenges. The United States Pacific Command (USPACOM) area of responsibility poses numerous challenges to SOCOMÍs task of CWMD. Chief among those regional challenges is North KoreaÍs nuclear weapons program, which is arguably one of the more hostile threats in the global CWMD arena. Dealing with CWMD threats on the Korean Peninsula will undoubtedly be complex, as the United States Government (USG) and USPACOM lack an established formal structure to adequately deal with problems such as counter-proliferation. The combination of the high threat and lack of pre-coordinated response make Korea susceptible to CWMD-related issues. That said, numerous CWMD capabilities exist on both the South Korean and USG side.  Q: How should the USG and USSPACOM improve cooperation with the South Korean CWMD community to accomplish mutual goals in the realm of counter-proliferation? "
Student 14,"There are increasing efforts by defense analysts to identify the potential future effects of the additive manufacturing with U.S. adversaries, but seemingly little analysis on how additive manufacturing capabilities can increase the U.S. military's capacity to conduct missions.  In Afghanistan, my Special Forces Operational Detachment _ Alpha (ODA) had to wait for over a week to receive a transmission housing for an all-terrain vehicle.  ATVs were mission critical in my area or operation due to the proximity of HWY-1 and its propensity to contain IEDs.  Rather than waiting a week, an organic additive manufacturing capability would have allowed our ODA to fabricate the transmission without the additional risk of transporting the part to our site by higher headquarters in a timely manner.  This capability would also prevent a significant negative impact to our force protection measures while conducting combat operations. Special Operations Forces (SOF) has always been at the forefront of testing new equipment and developing new processes prior to full implementation for general-purpose forces.  There is a unique opportunity for senior military leaders to utilize SOF formations to test additive manufacturing as a new input into the supply chain.  Simultaneously, US SOF will benefit by having an increased capability to sustain itself in austere conditions (with an existing power solution) to accomplish its mission.  There are already some organic additive manufacturing capabilities at SOF operational level headquarters. Special Operations Forces need to have an additive manufacturing capability at the lowest organic level in order to bridge its capability into the future and to provide proof of concept for the basis of non-standard/non-traditional logistics for the rest of the military.  How exactly, can additive manufacturing change the way that US SOF conducts operations?  How can this emerging capability improve sustaining special operations?  What strategy would best take advantage of adding AM capability to enhance US SOF teamsÍ ability to accomplish its missions? "
Student 15,"In pursuit of mastery, Edwin Link, a civilian innovator, created the first flight simulator in the late 1920Ís.  Later versions of LinkÍs simulator would be purchased by the military to develop the trust and skill of pilots who in bad weather had to fly by instrument gauges.  Today, the average youth in American ñwill spend ñmore than ten thousand hours playing computer and video gamesî_the same amount of time theyÍve spent in school from high school graduation to fifth grade_ before their 21st birthday.  Recognizing this trend, Department of Defense (DOD) built an alliance that some refer to as the ñMilitary-Entertainment complex.î   This year, multiple commercial releases of virtual reality (VR) equipment from Oculus Rift, PlayStation VR, HTC Vive, Samsung Gear VR, and the release of MicrosoftÍs development edition of the HoloLens mixed reality system entered the market.  These low-cost immersive gaming systems may offer the possibility of personalized and decentralized professional developmental training. Our strategic competitors are using irregular tactics that expose the limits of AmericaÍs conventional military primacy; Special Operation CommandÍs (SOCOM) force modernization and development department uses offsets, to cultivate approaches that stimulate ingenuity and enable continued dominance.  Information theory and the corresponding expansion in computing ability has allowed the modeling of complex nonlinear interactions by incorporating interdisciplinary principles and relationships through general systems theory.  However, as one RAND Corporation study noted, sometimes complicated modeling and big data are not useful to military commanders. Immersive gaming makes models of complexity accessible when displayed in more tangible visual forms, and with repetition, intuitive cognition may occur more rapidly.  Simulations and gaming equipped with models of complex environments and interactions hold promise not only as a tool for cognitive training but also for maintaining competitive advantage in research and development.  DOD has strategically co-opted the gaming movement to improve tactical and operational actions. Gamification, using principles of gaming to learn, is not new; however, MooreÍs law, has mainstreamed use of Live, Virtual, and Composite military training. Given this context, how should SOCOM modify existing immersive gaming efforts to enhance force readiness?"
Student 16,"Why Failing Terrorist Groups Persist Revisited:  A Social Network Approach to AQIM Resilience and Recruitment General Area of Proposed Thesis Research: Significant research has been done to identify what drives individuals to join terror and insurgent groups.  Explanations range from arguments that it is ñsocially determinedî by the larger social experience, to individual pathologies (some people are bad), to ideology, and„of course„economic deprivation.  However, the research into how terror groups can manipulate and exploit social networks to recruit individuals to their cause as well as embed their organizations into local communities has not been widely investigated and the scope of social dynamics at play is not fully explored. Following the failure of operations in Mali, AQIM lost a significant number of fighters and capabilities.  However, they have managed to regain their numbers and operational capacity, while expanding operations in Mali, Burkina Faso, Libya, Mauritania, and Ivory coast. Since the inception of its predecessor the Group for Salafist Preaching and Combat (GSPC) and before that the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria (GIA), AQIM has principally consisted of ethnic Arabs of Algerian nationality.  However, AQIMÍs exile to the Sahel after sustained losses to the Algerian security forces precipitated an organizational evolution that incorporates a greater share of Sub-Saharan ethnicities in both its front-line forces and its leadership positions.  How has AQIM managed to expand its network to attract and incorporate non-Arab ethnic members into what is ostensibly a movement designed to overthrow the Algerian government?  What methods does AQIM use to socially embed within the target populations to overcome organizational and cultural preferences for homophily?  How might the introduction of multiple ethnic groups into a violent religious organization affect targeting, ideology, and organizational behavior? Methods: Using geospatial, temporal, and social network analysis tools, this project will explore the social dynamics that facilitate an exogenous networkÍs ability to integrate and embed itself into multiple ethnic networks while overcoming its own internal homophily.  How does AQIMÍs success inform how US Special Operations Forces can better integrate and develop indigenous networks in foreign resistance groups while overcoming social barriers to network entry? "
