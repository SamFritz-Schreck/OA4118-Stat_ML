The BBMM is applied to a military scenario where U.S. forces are conducting surveillance to monitor the breakout of Chinese forces in the South China Sea. Probability heat maps, depicting the probability of a target location at discrete times, are generated through simulations in MATLAB. Using the heat maps, this thesis developed an algorithm to automate the placement of sensors to detect the target. This thesis focused on the use of a network of unmanned sensors as the means for target detection. The relationship between the sensors' attributes and the probability of detection is explored through a meta-experiment. The experiment utilizes a three-stage algorithm that generates heat maps, deploys sensors and randomizes intelligence inputs, and measures the probability of detection. A trade-off analysis was conducted and showed that to achieve a higher probability of detection, it is more effective to have sensors cover a wider area at fewer discrete points in time than to have a greater number of discrete looks using sensors covering smaller areas.","Major, Singapore Armed Forces, Army",http://hdl.handle.net/10945/50522,"Monterey, California: Naval Postgraduate School",Brownian bridge movement models||unmanned sensors||probability of detection||search and detection||simulations,A Brownian bridge movement model to track mobile targets,Thesis,Operations Research,Masters,Master of Science in Operations Research

Inaccurate forecasts put the Navy's budget at risk and degrade overall mission readiness. Navy policymakers must be able to rely on accurate inventory forecasts to develop necessary manpower plans that steer inventory to match planned authorizations. Strength planners, in turn, rely on forecasting models like the Officer Strategic Analysis Model (OSAM) in an attempt to accurately predict future inventory levels. This study utilizes applications of data farming to OSAM to simulate Unrestricted Line Officer (URL) inventory over a seven-year period. Additionally, the research utilizes applications of Design of Experiments (DOE) to project Surface Warfare Officer (SWO) inventory across a variety of assumptions, including a proposed Enhanced Probationary Officer Continuation and Re-designation (EPOCR) policy. Analysis finds that current policy will reduce FY2016 URL inventory by 8% over a seven-year period, and over-execute SWO inventory authorizations by 40%. We find that EPOCR reduces operating strength deviation (OSD) in total SWO inventory strength by 12% by FY2022. Additionally, implementing a low accession plan and a high transfer plan is the most robust in correcting OSD. When implemented correctly, EPOCR has the potential to decrease OSD to modest levels with minimal risk of under-execution.","Lieutenant, United States Navy",http://hdl.handle.net/10945/50586,"Monterey, California: Naval Postgraduate School",Manpower||end strength||design of experiments||simulation||Officer Strategic Analysis Model (OSAM)||inventory projection||data farming.

Logistic regression and machine learning models are used for data analysis. The study concludes that a simple, executable model that consolidates the variables to two explanatory factors performs as well, if not better than, the more complicated machine learning models. The two highly influential factors are the number of prescription sources for opioid medications and the total number of diagnoses. This logistic regression model has the potential to benefit Navy Medicine to make important decisions for their opioid-prescribed patients. With the ability to identify the risk that an opioid user becomes a high user, healthcare leaders can better manage resources to focus on the prevention and treatment of higher-risk patients.

MCERM optimally minimizes both (a) a function of transit distance and equipment size to transfer equipment to a unit (used as a surrogate for actual transfer cost), and (b) inventory shortages. MCERM allows planners to influence recommended transfers by (a) placing a weighted penalty on transfers that cross between commands, and (b) increasing the shortage penalty over the transfer penalty.

One risk metric, the superquantile, possesses several properties that make it particularly well-suited for risk quantification. Observable data, however, often lack information on extreme events due to various resource constraints, resulting in sample superquantile estimates that often undervalue the true level of risk. By leveraging the dual relationship between superquantiles and superexpectations, we apply constrained optimization on second-order epi-splines to arrive at incrementally better approximations of superquantile values. With these improved estimates, we incorporate additional constraints to improve the fidelity of density estimates in tail regions. We limit our investigation to data with heavy tails, where risk quantification is typically the most difficult. Demonstrations are provided in the form of a known distributional benchmark, historical financial data, and a fluid dynamics model used in the development of a high-speed naval vessel.

After applying spatial analysis to two open-source maps, we apply utility theory, the Analytical Hierarchy Process, and the Nash arbitration scheme to propose an arbitration solution. The arbitration solution tends to allocate to Turkey those islands with larger areas of territorial waters and greater proximity to the Turkish mainland, and allocate to Greece those islands with larger population and greater proximity to the Greek mainland.","Lieutenant Junior Grade, Turkish Naval Forces",http://hdl.handle.net/10945/49378,"Monterey, California: Naval Postgraduate School",spatial analysis||game theory||Nash arbitration scheme||Aegean||disputed islands||territorial waters||utilization||Turkey||Greece||bargaining problem||analytical hierarchy process,A spatial analysis and game theoretical approach over the disputed islands in the Aegean Sea,Thesis,Operations Research,Masters,Master of  Science in Operations Research

Despite the spending of over $75 billion to combat this threat, intelligence analysts still lack efficient tools to conduct IED pattern analysis. This thesis evaluates sinusoidal models for effectiveness in assisting in the identification of IED patterns. We formulate three models to test against IED patterns encountered in Iraq and Afghanistan: the Hawkes point process, the non-linear optimization of a sine function, and discrete Fourier transforms (DFT). Non-linear optimization and DFT models both out-perform a mean inter-arrival model when applied to representative IED patterns. We also applied these models against portions of an Iraq IED dataset using a rolling horizon forecast. Lastly, we test model performance when applied to patterns identified from the Iraq dataset. We conclude that although there is not a silver bullet for IED pattern detection, the use of these models in IED environments has the potential to reduce the amount of time and effort intelligence analysts expend when identifying IED patterns. We recommend incorporating these models into a graphic user interface usable by intelligence analysts responsible for IED pattern recognition.","Major, United States Army",http://hdl.handle.net/10945/49454,"Monterey, California: Naval Postgraduate School",improvised explosive device||IED||Hawkes point process||discrete Fourier transforms||pattern recognition||rolling horizon forecast,IED pattern recognition using sinusoidal models,Thesis,Operations Research,Masters,Master of  Science in Operations Research

Briefly, lower-level, higher-resolution models provide input to higher-level, lower-resolution models. This allows analysts to explore how engineering and tactics changes can affect campaign effectiveness. This thesis builds upon previous research and examines various methods for employing distributions of engagement-level model outputs as input to campaign-level models, instead of just using the average. We contrast methods for linking the engagement-level model to the campaign-level model. Previous research indicates that when expected values alone are propagated through layers of combat models, the final results will likely be biased, and risk underestimated. An air-to-air engagement model is developed to generate a data library that is used as input in a stochastic Lanchester campaign model. A variety of sampling methods are employed to sample from the engagement model's output data library to provide input to the campaign model. The results indicate that the manner in which the engagement and campaign models are linked has substantial impact on the estimates of operational effectiveness and risk. Additionally, our research illustrates how running a designed experiment on the engagement-level model, to generate a library of data that can be linked to the campaign-level model, can support robust decision making.","Captain, Turkish Air Forces",http://hdl.handle.net/10945/49494,"Monterey, California: Naval Postgraduate School",hierarchical combat modeling||air combat modeling||campaign analysis||mean and variance analysis||sampling methods||metamodeling||error propagation||Lanchester equations||agent-based simulation||design of experiments||simulation output analysis,Analysis of error propagation within hierarchical air combat models,Thesis,Operations Research,Masters,Master of  Science in Operations Research

The smuggler seeks to maximize the amount of forces and materiel infiltrated from an origin to destination. The interdictor seeks to minimize this smuggler flow. Using two simple examples of an illicit-trafficking network, we demonstrate how to use these quantitative models within such an interdictor-smuggler context to (1) evaluate the value of seizures as a proxy for smuggled materiel, (2) assess the value of exploration, and (3) provide decision makers with practical ways to better allocate resources and increase effectiveness.","Major, United States Marine Corps",http://hdl.handle.net/10945/49329,"Monterey, California: Naval Postgraduate School",dynamic network interdiction||smuggling||evolutionary games||incomplete and asymmetric information||online learning||dynamic stochastic programming||adaptive risk management,An evolving asymmetric game for modeling interdictor-smuggler problems,Thesis,Operations Research,Masters,Master of  Science in Operations Research

Its inventory system is highly dynamic, and items may be requisitioned for long periods without undue delay followed by sudden, unexpected shortages that directly affect Navy combat readiness.

We also use popular visualization techniques grouped under the name multidimensional scaling. We compare the results using the tree distance and the t-SNE algorithm to results from using Gower dissimilarity and multidimensional scaling. Unlike established dimensionality reduction techniques, which generally map from high dimensions directly to two (or three) dimensions, we explore a new approach in which the dimensionality reduction takes place in several separate steps.

While most of these games focus on war, the Peace Game focuses on helping planners gain insight as to how Security Force Assistance (SFA) and Security Cooperation (SC) operations may unfold. The Peace Game attempts to model population behavior in a specific region. In the past, movement of the masses has been used as an indicator of regional stability. This thesis concentrates on assessing the migration algorithm within the Peace Game. While the current algorithm does a satisfactory job of simulating migration, it can be made better. The suggested improvements in the Peace Game focus on three models (two types of models). There are two regression models; one that models population deaths over time and another that models displaced persons over time. The third model is roughly based on a compounding interest model. This model is known as the Population Attrition Model (PAM) and is applied to both deaths and displaced persons.

This computational environment provides advantages for data preprocessing and postprocessing, including convenient and efficient methods for manipulating CI network data. Moreover, the object-oriented nature of Pyomo creates a natural means for representing interdependent CI systems. Specifically, the model for each CI system can be implemented as its own object, and the combined model can be implemented as another object built from its dependent components. This allows for increased flexibility and extensibility beyond previous implementations. We manage the inputs and outputs of the models in a way to be able to compare them across studies, obtaining insight on their performance, interactions, and effectiveness.

The tool allows the user to generate alternate sequences of trials if an early trial fails.

Simulation is used at every level of the acquisition process, from platform design to tactics to force structure. In hierarchal combat modeling, the mean output of lower-level, higher-resolution models are used as inputs to higher-level, lower-resolution models. The goal of this process is to inform military commanders how design changes in new platforms will affect tactical performance, and how changes in tactical performance can enhance campaign effectiveness. This thesis uses a hierarchal modeling structure to examine whether including the distributions of mission model inputs instead of just the mean can affect campaign model results. A mission model of a one-on-one submarine battle is developed to determine the mean time to kill (MTTK) for the belligerents. The MTTK is sampled in a variety of ways, including just the mean, and used to calculate the attrition coefficients for a stochastic Lanchester campaign model that contains 18 Blue and 25 Red submarines. The outputs of the campaign models are analyzed statistically. The results indicate that the sampling methodology has a significant impact on the mean probability Blue wins the campaign and the mean amount of losses Blue takes when it wins. In addition, sampling methodology has a significant effect on the standard deviation for the probability Blue wins and the amount of losses Blue expects to take when it wins. These results also have practical significance: estimates of Blue_„_s average odds of winning range from 0.58 to 0.94, while estimates of average losses range from 4.69 to 8.31.

The proposed model, unlike current manual scheduling techniques, suggests schedules that are feasible, nearly optimal, and are produced quickly for effective analysis of alternatives.","Major, United States Marine Corps",http://hdl.handle.net/10945/45846,"Monterey, California: Naval Postgraduate School",Optimization||test and evaluation||integer linear programming||cascade||project scheduling||project management,Optimizing Department of Defense Acquisition Development Test and Evaluation scheduling,Thesis,Operations Research,Masters,Master of Science in Operations Research

When a vehicle becomes non-operational, we refer to it as a deadlining event. We analyze data collected from 3,154 Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR) vehicles between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2013. Data quality issues are present in vehicle serial numbers, maintenance defect codes, regional code, and odometer readings. Due to the high level of inaccuracy in odometer meter readings, vehicle mileage cannot be used as a metric for usage. We build Poisson generalized linear regression models to estimate the expected number of vehicle deadlining events. Without the presence of a true measurement of vehicle usage, the insight gained from fitting regression models to the maintenance data is limited. The number of unscheduled maintenance events acts as a surrogate usage measure within the model. In our model, more than one scheduled maintenance event per year shows evidence of reducing the number of deadlining events. We recommend the improvement of odometer meter reading accuracy in order to provide an effective usage measurement for future studies.","Captain, United States Marine Corps",http://hdl.handle.net/10945/45853,"Monterey, California: Naval Postgraduate School",Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement||MTVR||reliability||reliability analysis||Poisson regression||Poisson generalized linear model||data quality,Data quality and reliability analysis of U.S. Marine Corps ground vehicle maintenance records,Thesis,Operations Research,Masters,Master of Science in Operations Research

There is a need for a tool to optimize the placement of the available number of ships to candidate bases and the assignment of the AOs for each base.

This means that in a command and control denied environment (C2DE), a submarine may be incapable of receiving orders or transmitting required reports. In order to meet its communications requirements, the submarine has to navigate outside of the denied environment, conduct all necessary satellite communications, and proceed back to the C2DE zone.

This analysis explores the value of several different UUV characteristics as well as undersea garage configurations in minimizing the time it takes for a submarine to conduct its communications, the latency of the data received, and the cost of construction for the system.

Using historical solar data and simulated forecasts for wind data, we formulate and exercise a capital planning optimization model designed to choose the best subset of existing and potential energy sources to maximize microgrid islanding time.

These models will enable decision makers to effectively acquire and employ a UAV fleet for border surveillance.","First Lieutenant, Turkish Army",http://hdl.handle.net/10945/42729,"Monterey, California: Naval Postgraduate School",Border patrol||barrier search||UAV,Optimal deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles for border surveillance,Thesis,Operations Research,Masters,Master of Science in Operations Research

Also, they are unaware of other analysts with similar intelligence problems, preventing collaboration and often causing intelligence failure. To identify relevant information, analysts use adopted commercial search engines designed for internet-sized databases containing hyperlinked web-pages that are not effective on intelligence databases consisting of non-hyperlinked documents. This thesis outlines a model to fundamentally increase search effectiveness and collaboration by using a social network of like-minded users based on user biographies and search behavior. After entering a query, the likelihood of returning a relevant document is increased by leveraging data from other, similar users. The model goes beyond standard search engine design by presenting similar analysts for collaboration and presenting relevant documents without queries. Our framework is mathematically grounded in a Markov random field information retrieval model and recent developments in recommender systems. We build and test a prototype system on datasets from the National Institute of Standards & Technology. The test results combine with computational sensitivity analyses to show significant improvements over existing search models. The improvements are shown to be robust to high levels of human error and low similarity between users.","Captain, United States Marine Corps",http://hdl.handle.net/10945/42755,"Monterey, California: Naval Postgraduate School",Intelligence Community||information retrieval||recommender systems||search engines||social networks||user profiling||Lucene||robust design||collaborative systems,What friends are for: collaborative intelligence analysis and search,Thesis,Operations Research,Masters,Master of Science in Operations Research

Measuring distance for continuous variables often requires scaling or monotonic transformation. Determining dissimilarity when observations have both continuous and categorical measurements can be difficult because each type of measurement must be approached differently. We introduce a new clustering method that uses one of three new distance metrics. In a dataset with p variables, we create p trees, one with each variable as the response. Distance is measured by determining on which leaf an observation falls in each tree. Two observations are similar if they tend to fall on the same leaf and dissimilar if they are usually on different leaves. The distance metrics are not affected by scaling or transformations of the variables and easily determine distances in datasets with both continuous and categorical variables. This method is tested on several well-known datasets, both with and without added noise variables, and performs very well in the presence of noise due in part to automatic variable selection. The new distance metrics outperform several existing clustering methods in a large number of scenarios.","Lieutenant, United States Navy",http://hdl.handle.net/10945/41412,"Monterey, California: Naval Postgraduate School",Clustering||Regression Trees||Classification Trees||Cramrs V,A scale-independent clustering method with automatic variable selection based on trees,Thesis,Operations Research,Masters,Master Of Science In Operations Research

Eliminating insignificant parameters could reduce the run-time of an experiment, thereby allowing a more robust design to be used only on the significant factors that are selected. The ability of the method to properly identify significant parameters is analyzed by creating a model in which the significant factors are already known and determining how well the method identifies the significant factors. The results of the analysis show that the method is effective when the factors are moderately to highly significant and for a small number of significant factors.

The first such approach extends an existing two-dimensional geographic allocation method to three dimensions. This allows for an allocation of the operating space to radar assets and can serve as a preallocation heuristic for more sophisticated assignment algorithms.

The cost to meet petroleum reduction mandates by transitioning light-duty fleets to PEDVs is cost prohibitive and impractical, requiring almost a complete one-for-one replacement of the current fleet of traditional light-duty passenger vehicles. Realistically meeting the mandate without fleet downsizing will require implementing a transition toward alternatively fueled vehicles beyond the light-duty passenger vehicle class.

We analyze four initial basic network configurations and compare the resulting optimum node placements when the network is not subject to attack, when the network is subject to two attacks, and when the flow of each network configuration is completely blocked by attacks.","Lieutenant, United States Navy",http://hdl.handle.net/10945/37637,"Monterey, California: Naval Postgraduate School",Defender-Attacker-Defender (DAD)||Dual-Integer Linear Program (DILP)||Attacker-Defender (AD)||Subproblem||Network Optimization||Tri-Level Optimization||Communications Networks||Sensor Networks||Network Design||Network Interdiction||Undersea Distributed Networks||Seaweb||Submarine Communications at Speed & Depth (CSD)||Ocean Acoustics||Acoustic Communications||Acomms||FORCEnet||Deep Sound Channel (DSC),The optimal employment and defense of a deep seaweb acoustic network for submarine communications at speed and depth using a defender-attacker-defender model,Thesis,Operations Research,Masters,Master Of Science In Operations Research

A dedicated adversary air force supports the majority of adversary training missions, but these airframes are aging and lack the sortie generation capacity and the performance capabilities to completely satisfy the training requirements. The Navy currently uses other opposition forces to fill the gap between the adversary air force capacity and the demand for training. This training gap will grow over the next decade as current airframes reach their flight hour limits, and as resources become scarcer, the task of determining efficient assignment of these resources becomes more difficult for planners and the resulting solutions are more expensive than necessary. This thesis presents the Adversary Sortie Optimization Tool, which uses an integer-linear program to optimize the assignment of adversary air sorties to meet the annual fleet training demands over a 20-year planning horizon, and prescribes yearly upgrades to the adversary air force, including procurement of performance enhancing aircraft pods, improved radar, new aircraft, and system upgrades. Solutions provide a reduction in operating costs of hundreds of millions of dollars using efficient sortie assignment, aircraft and system upgrades, and managing the home base location of aircraft. These savings are achieved while also improving the quality of training and saving valuable hours on fleet aircraft.","Lieutenant Commander, United States Navy",http://hdl.handle.net/10945/37674,"Monterey, California: Naval Postgraduate School",Optimization||integer-linear program||United States Navy||adversary||strikefighter squadron||aviation||air combat||training||readiness 15.NUMBER OFPAGES 111,Optimizing adversary training and the structure of the Navy adversary fleet,Thesis,Operations Research,Masters,Master Of Arts Science In Operations Research

One of the prominent ways in which traffickers smuggle drugs into the United States is by maritime shipments from South America. In 1989 Joint Interagency Task Force South (JIATF-S) was established to fight these traffickers. JIATF-S collects information from multiple sources, which can be broadly classified into two categories. The first category is sensor-based sources that produce observations about possible targets (e.g., radar, sonar). These observations provide precise location and time but are susceptible to false positive and false negative errors regarding their content. The second category is human-based sources, including tips, messages and intercepted communications among humans. In addition to possible misinformation regarding the content of an event, such inputs are also susceptible to errors regarding the location and time of the event. In this thesis we develop a data fusion model that can assist JIATF-S in estimating the likelihood that a certain target (i.e., drug-smuggling vessel) is present at a certain location at a certain time and evaluate the reliability of the information source.

MCF-CA is a multi-period evacuation model that uses a novel approach called congestion assignment to analyze clearing times during mass evacuations. Congestion assignment discretizes the nonlinear relationship between the number of vehicles on a road segment and the maximum speed at which those vehicles can travel. MCF-CA selects among three congestion levels (none, moderate, and high) for each road segment in each time epoch. Depending on the congestion level selected, MCF-CA limits the number of vehicles that are able to traverse the road segment and uses Akeliks Time-Dependent Speed-Flow Function (Akelik 2003) to determine the average travel speed of the vehicles for that time period. As a result, we are able to determine approximate evacuation clearing times under nonlinear congestion effects by solving an integer linear program. We limit residents prior knowledge of traffic conditions by implementing MCF-CA in a rolling horizon fashion and study the impact of this limited knowledge on evacuation patterns. We also model the impact of sub-optimal routing decisions on the part of residents by artificially shifting residents toward their own shortest paths rather than a socially optimal route. We find that a mass evacuation can more than double the clearing times of individual county evacuations. However, during both county and mass evacuations, resident routing choices significantly impact clearing times. As more residents choose suboptimal routes, clearing times are prolonged. Lastly, we find that more than 50% of residents will experience congestion at some point during the evacuation horizon. However, allowing some congestion improves evacuation clearing times by 2036% over not congesting. Although congestion decreases vehicle travel speed by 7080%, over 50% more residents are able to start or continue evacuating during each time epoch.","Lieutenant Commander, United States Navy",http://hdl.handle.net/10945/32861,"Monterey, California.

From the significant covariates for the treatment model, a simple, scoring-scheme heuristic was developed to enable treatment providers to expeditiously and accurately assess relative risk of premature discharge among a cohort of veteran clients. Using demographic information from three simple questions, the scoring scheme has a 98.3% correlation to the theoretical probability of failure from treatment and gives providers a simple and accurate way to identify those at greater risk of early exit.

We compare relying on this estimated location with current practice of using the corresponding center point of a given Operational Area Box (OP Box) and determine the impact of this centroid location on CLF assets, fuel cost, and time. The Pacific Coast scenario that we present uses the Replenishment at-Sea Planner (RASP) to find the optimal scheduling of RAS events at both the OP Box center point and the estimated RAS location. The results show that the centroid location offers significant improvements in customer readiness and total CLF underway fuel usage planning.","Lieutenant, United States Navy",http://hdl.handle.net/10945/27796,"Monterey, California.

The focus of this study was specifically on the flight regimes encountered by helicopter pilots. Information obtained from this research may aid training effectiveness specific to helicopter aviation. Methods There were 17 military officers, all active-duty Navy helicopter pilots, who all had different levels of flight experience based on their total flight times. Each pilot was asked to successfully fly and navigate a course through a simulated southern Californian desert in a fixed-based helicopter simulator modeled after the U.S. Navys MH-60S. The location of their scan was tracked by an eye-tracking system in order to determine scan rate and locations while they flew the course. All of the flight parameters, such as airspeed and altitude, were recorded by the simulators recording system. Results Analysis of the results obtained from the eye tracking system indicated a decreasing relationship between scan rate and pilot experience, indicating that the scan rate decreases as a pilot becomes more experienced. The analysis uses altitude variance as a measure of performance. Results indicate that higher scan rates correlate with higher degrees of variance in the altitude, indicating that a quicker scan does not necessarily result in better performance. The higher experienced pilots show a lower altitude variance overall (they were more consistent in maintaining a constant altitude above the ground), yet those pilots all exhibited slower scan rates. Discussion The integration of the eye tracking technology with a simulator representing an aircraft currently in service was a success. Although none of the null hypotheses presented were rejected, trends were evident in scan rates when compared with pilot experience. The relatively small sample size was identified as the major causal factor for the lack of significance.","Commander, United States Navy",http://hdl.handle.net/10945/17387,"Monterey, California.

We find that substantial preprocessing must done before statistical methods can be applied to raw network data, that no single predictor is sufficient, and that the most effective statistical analysis is logistic regression. Our approach is novel in that we consider not only single predictor events, but also combinations of reports from multiple tools. While we consider a number of different statistical techniques, we find that the most satisfactory model is based on logistic regression. Finally, we conclude that while the Skaion dataset is valuable in terms of its new approach to network traffic emulation, the 1999 KDD Cup and DARPA-MIT datasetsdespite their many shortcomingsare more clearly organized and accessible to academic study.

Questions have arisen regarding the degree to which retention goals would be met if special bonus pay programs were reduced or eliminated. Mattock and Arkes (2007) claimed success with predicting the retention of Air Force pilots by using their Dynamic Retention Model (DRM). This thesis utilizes the DRM, coded for R by Mattock and Arkes, to create a simulation of Naval aviator retention at different bonus amounts. The model predicted a 75.2 per cent retention rate with a bonus of $25,000 per year for five years, a retention rate of 64.3 per cent with a bonus of $15,000 per year for five years, and a retention rate of 50.6 per cent with a bonus of $5,000 per year. It predicted that only 14 Naval Aviators (0.46 per cent) would remain past their minimum service requirement if the bonus were discontinued. A critique of the DRM is that it is an econometric approach that leaves out other factors.

Given the nature of responsibilities placed on U.S. Navy watchstanders, working under conditions of avoidable sleep deprivation is unacceptable. Using information gained from a predictive performance model instantiated in the Fatigue Avoidance Scheduling Tool (FAST), the optimal watch alternative plan to use is a 3/9-watch rotation, where personnel stand three hours of watch followed by nine hours off. This thesis attempted to quantify the effects of sleep deprivation on performance and to determine how that performance is changed through the use of the 3/9-watch rotation compared to a traditional four section 5/15-watch. Results comparing performance to sleep showed performance did increase with higher sleep levels and indicated better performance for personnel standing watch at certain times of the day. Overall, the 3/9- rotation was not only preferred by the crew, but was shown to have actual measurable benefit in performance.","Lieutenant, United States Navy",http://hdl.handle.net/10945/17485,"Monterey, California.

The goal is to identify valid values for M that also lead to short solution times. One algorithm initializes large instances of M (giving a weak relaxation of the MIP), and decreases these as required to increase efficiency of the standard B and B. Two algorithms initialize small and possibly invalid instances of M, and subsequently increase those values in an attempt to ensure solution validity. Each algorithm requires a model-specific test condition to detect weak or invalid Ms. We test all algorithms on an uncapacitated k-median problem (a variant of the uncapacitated facility location problem), and one algorithm on a shortest-path interdiction problem (SPIP). We observe substantial reduction in run times in almost all cases tested. When solving for exact solutions, computational results show that the proposed algorithms may reduce solution times by up to 75 per cent  for the uncapacitated k-median problem and 99 per cent for the SPIP. When the algorithms yield marginally suboptimal solutions, substantial solution-time improvements are also recorded. While testing is limited, this thesis serves as a proof-of-concept that the proposed adaptive algorithms can be effective in reducing solution times and producing optimal or nearly optimal solutions.","Major, Singapore Army",http://hdl.handle.net/10945/17370,"Monterey, California.

Therefore, preparedness for an outbreak is a high priority within the livestock industry, and state and federal government. We use simulation and a designed experiment to identify robust governmental and industrial surveillance response strategies to control the spread of FMD. A strategy is considered robust if it is effective across a number of outbreak scenarios and a variety of disease spread characteristics. The main contributions of this thesis are (1) the development of FMD outbreak scenarios across California that can be used in conjunction with a state-of-the-art, animal disease simulation model, and (2) the development and analysis of an efficient experimental design that allows for the identification of key parameters affecting the spread and containment of an FMD outbreak. The analysis of over 400,000 simulations in the experimental design indicates two key areas for the control ofFMD (1) surveillance activities at dairy and dairy-like premises are a dominant factor in early identification of the disease and increased surveillance leads to lower impacts of an outbreak, and (2) fast initial response and capacity of depopulation resources are also key factors in controlling an FMD outbreak, even when no preemptive depopulation strategies are considered.","Lieutenant Colonel, United States Army Reserve",http://hdl.handle.net/10945/7304,"Monterey, California.

We represent countries, cable landing stations, and undersea cables using a network structure of nodes and edges that closely imitates the real-world system. For a given geographic region, we connect individual networks associated with stand-alone cable systems to create one large network model. We use a gravity model to estimate the traffic demand between each pair of countries based on the number of Internet hosts in each country. We formulate and solve an Attacker-Defender (AD) model to identify the worst-case disruptions, where a worst-case disruption corresponds to the greatest shortage in telecommunications traffic even after the system has rebalanced flows as best as possible. Using public sources of data, we collect information about more than 220 real cable systems, and we develop a customized decision support tool that facilitates the analysis of different combinations of countries and cable systems. We demonstrate our modeling technique with an analysis of the undersea cable infrastructure connecting Europe and India. Our analysis provides insight into which components in the system are most vulnerable along with how effectively the system performs in the face of disruptions.","Major, United States Army",http://hdl.handle.net/10945/7327,"Monterey, California.

The defender's problem is represented as a minimum cost, multi-commodity network flow model. System cost is measured in terms of total ton-n.m. in the network. Our network contains the 120 most important ports in the world (by volume of cargo), 35 waypoints at sea, and 416 arcs. Port supply and demand have been estimated from different sources. Interdictions represent manmade disruption of the seaways, such as those in the presence of piracy. An interdicted arc is assumed to incur a penalty equivalent to the additional distance that a ship would need to travel in order to avoid the threat, or a total blockade of the arc in the case of straits and canals. We analyze several scenarios with varying assumptions on the defended arcs and the number of simultaneous interdictions. The most disruptive, single interdiction occurs in the Strait of  Gibraltar, increasing cost by almost 25%, followed by the Straits of Bab el Mandeb (20%) and Suez Canal (19%). For two simultaneous interdictions, cost increases to 33%, but decreases to 23%, 8% and 1.5% when we defend three, four or five select straits and canals, respectively.","Lieutenant Colonel, Argentine Air Force",http://hdl.handle.net/10945/7344,"Monterey, California.

The defender selects the locations to install multiple interceptor types, with uncertainty in the attacker's origin and destination, in order to minimize the probability of evasion, or the expected target value collected by the evader. Then, the attacker reveals an origin-destination pair (independent of the defender's decision), and sends a strike package along a path (through the interdicted network) that maximizes his probability of evasion.

Solving these problems analytically often requires simplifying assumptions, running the risk of making a Type III error (i.e., getting the right answer to the wrong problem). This paper explores the development of computer simulation, and the key design principles that must be followed, to demonstrate how simulation is often the appropriate tool in understanding complex, real-world problems. Contrasting the results of a recently published analytical approach to the analysis of an airport check-in counter scheduling problem versus those of a simulation study of the same system, we demonstrate that simulation can quickly provide the same answers with any desired degree of precision and with no loss of insight.

We then modify the replica model to more accurately reflect reality. This improved model uses a continuous time Markov process to model weather. We show that the independent weather assumption in the ITC model is inappropriate.

Congestion may be experienced in phases that require time consuming tasks such as translation, processing and analysis. To ameliorate the performance of those timeconsuming phases, a preliminary classification of intelligence items regarding their relevance and value to an intelligence request is performed. This classification is subject to false positive and false negative errors, where an item is classified as positive if it is relevant and provides valuable information to an intelligence request, and negative otherwise. The tradeoff between both types of errors, represented visually by the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, depends on the training and capabilities of the classifiers as well as the classification test performed on each item and the decision rule that separates between positives and negatives. An important question that arises is how to best tune the classification process such that both accuracy of the classification and its timeliness are adequately addressed.

This thesis considers an alternative approach to RBDO that uses the ""buffered failure probability,"" and develops four new solution algorithms based on sample-average approximations. Buffered failure probability is more conservative than failure probability and it is much easier to handle in optimization algorithms.

To enable an effective seabase, the Office of Naval research is leading an effort to design and develop a seabase connector known as the Transformable Craft (T-Craft). The T-Craft is intended to provide ""game changing capabilities"" for seabasing operations--substantially outperforming any seabase connector in the Navy's current inventory. Through the use of simulation, state-of-the-art design of experiments, and advanced data analysis, this research modeled and analyzed over 430,000 seabasing missions by varying the number of T-Craft, their capabilities (e.g., speed), the types of weapon systems carried, tactics, escort mixes, and threat level in order to determine which combinations obtain the highest survivability and throughput rate for the T-Craft. As a result of the research and analysis, the following were found: (1) the presence of escorts (at least two LCS in the scenarios we examined) is critical when a threat exists; (2) the operating speed of the T-craft must be determined by the operating capabilities of the escorts; and (3) the shoreline threat remains a critical area in ensuring T-Craft survivability.",US Marine Corps (USMC) author,http://hdl.handle.net/10945/5297,"Monterey, California.
